Version 1.0.1
-------------

Small change to make the board holders (bh) thinner as they interfered with
some buttons on the large nucleo boards. They are a bit more flimsy but enough
for the purpose and allows more overall height.

- Both the bh and bh_long are the only things affected.
- The stability_z size decreased from 1.6mm to 0.8mm

Version 1.0.0
-------------

The internal board holders are not compatible with previous modular cases due
to the change of position of the USB socket position. However, previous modular
cases fit the same grid and can be used with the current design.

- Replaced vendor specific USB holder design with generic USB holder
- Added new PCB board holder clips allowing corners to fit a 2.5mm grid instead
of every 10mm.
- Added triangle edges for the board holder card to improve warping of the case
when weight is applied
- Added more support beams through the board holder card
- Added better guide rails to the modular case
- Added holes for light pipes to the module case
- Added 2.5mm holes (20 mm x 108.6mm) with nut support for USB hub PCB mounting
- Added 2.5mm holes to the front edges of the module case to prevent slipping
- Standardize the board holder grid
- Changed the back of the board holder to make it stronger and save material
